### Hi there 👋

I'm Matisse Page.

🎓 Currently a 3rd year student at Epitech Montpellier, I am developing skills related to programming and innovation in IT. I am also a Project Manager within the Junior Council of Epitech Taker.

💪 Thanks to Epitech and my various personal projects, I master different languages ​​such as C, PHP or even JavaScript. I like to learn new technologies, I'm currently training in React, Nodejs. I also learned with my experience as a Project Manager the relationship with clients and teamwork in order to deliver quality projects and on time.

🚀 With my different skills, I was able to do an internship at Sequoia Soft in order to help them redesign their customer portal.

❤️ I'm passionate about sports. I have been playing soccer in club for many years. I was also a coach teams of young players. I'm also discovering other sports such as beach volley, wakeboard or wing foil.
