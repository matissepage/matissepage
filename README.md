### Hi there 👋

I'm Matisse Page.

🎓 Currently a 4th year student at Epitech Montpellier. I am in an international year at Long Beach University in California.

💪 Thanks to Epitech and my different personal projects, I develop skills related to programming and innovation in computer science. I like learning new technologies, I master languages like Javascript (React, Nodejs, typescript) or C and C++. I also learned with my experience as a Project Manager the relationship with customers and teamwork to deliver quality projects in time. 

🚀 I was brought to realise different internships which allowed me to acquire technical skills, but also to be sensitised to make a work deliverable to a customer.

🫀 I am passionate about sports. I have been practicing for many years soccer in club. I have also been able to coach teams of young players. I am also discovering other sports such as beach volleyball, wakeboard or wingfoil.

📝 If you are interested, do not hesitate to contact me by email at matisse.page@epitech.eu or directly on Linkedin
